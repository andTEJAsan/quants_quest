# Quants Quest
- Problem set created by Me, Pravar Kataria and Pratyush Sharma based on various concepts of Options, finance, probability and algorithms.
- It was conducted in 2 parts, and the cost of attempting the 2nd part was 10 points.
- Problems in the 2nd part were significantly harder than the 1st part. (But at the same time the reward was higher).
- We wanted to see how many people would be able to take a risk and solve the 2nd part as well.
